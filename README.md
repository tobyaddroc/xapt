# xApt

A package manager for Windows similar to Linux Apt.
## Installation
### Windows 10

 1. Open command line with admin rights.
 2. `cd Project-dir\BatchScripts`
 3. `.\Install official build (Windows 10).bat`
 4. Well done!

### Windows 11

 1. Open command line with admin rights.
 2. `cd Project-dir\BatchScripts`
 3. `.\Install official build (Windows 11).bat`
 4. Well done!

## Usage
After installing open command line with admin rights **or** open Win+R and type `xapt shell`.

If you are working outside the `xapt shell`, then all commands will start with the word `xapt` followed by the launch arguments. In the `xapt shell`, the word `xapt` is already included by default, if you want help while in the `xapt shell`, just press **Enter**.

You can see how to use `xapt` in detail already in it, I wrote above how to do it.
## Compiling
For those who have not yet figured out how to build xapt:

 1. Open solution file in Visual Studio **2022**
 2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+B**
 3. Build should appear at the ***Project-Dir*\Build\Release\net6.0-windows10.0.19041.0**

## Final
Enjoy using xapt!
